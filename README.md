# user_charts
User-driven D3.js Charts that provide forms that allowing users to input data influencing D3.js charts.

Currently this module provides a user-driven PCoA Chart only. You can see this chart in action over at [bl.ocks.org]
(http://bl.ocks.org/laceysanderson/0173ae42017a47665e2e) and you can see the code behind the actual chart in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/laceysanderson/0173ae42017a47665e2e).

Further development in the form of additional charts and improved error/security checking is to come.
